# airbn-c a Full-stack MERN Airbnb-Clone


I created a MERN-based Airbnb clone with crucial features, including secure authentication, search and filter functions, booking, hosting, and payment processes. Leveraging MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for server-side development, and React.js for client-side development, the application provides a scalable and seamless user experience for booking accommodations.
