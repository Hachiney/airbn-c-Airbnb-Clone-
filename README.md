# airbn-c a Full-stack MERN Airbnb-Clone



- Front-end:     React.js

- Back-end:      Node.js, Express.js

- Database:      MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM


It is a pleasure to share with you about this exciting project that I have made recently. It's a MERN-based Airbnb clone that offers essential features, such as secure authentication, search and filter functions, booking, hosting, and payment processes.

This application provides an exceptional user experience that is scalable and seamless for booking accommodations by leveraging the power of MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for server-side development, and React.js for client-side development.

On the front-end, I utilized React.js to create a responsive and intuitive user interface, while on the back-end, I implemented the robust combination of Node.js and Express.js to build interactive and efficient server-side application. Additionally, I used MongoDB as the database, along with the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to make data management more efficient and organized.
